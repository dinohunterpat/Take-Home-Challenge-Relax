# Take-Home-Challenge-Relax
The goal of this project is to examine which factors are associated with "adopted user" who log into the product on three separate days in at least one sevenÂ­-day period. The main attributes of the users are Organization ID, Creation Source, Opt-In Status, Invited by Users ID, and Enabling for Marketing Drip. The data is indexed by object ID for individual users with all values converted to numerical dummy variables and given boolean active/non-active status. Once the data has been properly cleaned and organized, machine learning models were applied to determine which features have the most importance. For this project, classification type models were used since the outcome of adopted versus non-adopted is a categorical variable. Based on the different models used, the most reliable model is the gradient boosting model. Using this model as a base, the importance values of the different attributes were calculated and they showed that Organization ID and Guest Invites are most important. This suggests that users are turned into adopted users when introduced by an organization or invite.
